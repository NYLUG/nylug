Upgrades notes
---------------

Follow this instructions to upgrade between fully packaged minor version releases
of the Recruiter distribution, e.g. from 1.0-beta1 to 1.0-beta2.


1. As for any upgrade, backup the code and the database and turn on
   maintenance mode.

2. Replace your codebase (excluding the sites directory) with the contents of
   the fully-packaged Recruiter release archive.

   Do not *merge* the codebases, as some files might have been relocated!

3. Update your site via update.php.

4. Navigate to the Features module admin page (admin/structur/features). All
   features should be marked as default if that was the case before upgrading.

   For any features that were overridden, carefully review the changes, e.g.
   with the help of the diff module (disabled by default). If possible, just
   remove any customizations and revert the overridden components to the
   provided defaults.

   The new release might include some new features you may want to enable.

5. If everything went fine, disable the maintenance mode. That's it.
