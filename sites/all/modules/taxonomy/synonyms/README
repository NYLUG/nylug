Synonyms is a small module that makes it possible to search for taxonomy term synonyms via the built-in search module.

Here's the thread that started it all: http://drupal.org/node/83027

For the module to find your content, your search index needs to be updated regularly. 
See: Administer >> Settings >> Search.
