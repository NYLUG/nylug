Description
-----------

This module allows you to assign class to the listed items of an ordered or 
unordered list that is generate as a display in views.

The main application for this is when generating blocks that will be styled to 
appear in columns.

It is even more powerful when used with themes with responsive design because it 
encourages you to use grid class to specify the width of your block which can 
then be given a different width depending on the gird that is being apply based 
upon the screen resolution.

You can address the problem of having margin on items that in your left and 
right columns by giving those on the left a class of alpha and those on the 
right a class of omega.

These means that you can avoid setting fixed widths on blocks that wrap your 
view and giving the outer wrapping div and overflow of hidden to accommodate the 
margin on the right of your blocks.

Additionally, you can apply multiple column class settings using the advanced 
classes textarea. This has the potential of allow you to display your items in 4 
columns for higher screen resolutions and 2 columns for your mobile devices.
